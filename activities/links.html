    <p>What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</p>
    <p>
        The root is the top starting folder in the computer. A folder holds files and other folders. A file is a document,pictures or program and the path shows the location using roots,folder,and file name .
     </p>
     <p>what is a default document ? </p>
    <p> A default document is the file that a computer or web server opens automatically when no file name is given.</p>
    <p>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</p>
    <p>Absolute link showsnthe full address with domain name , Relative links shows the short path from the current folder or page and easier to move the whole website to another server.</p>
