            <p> The first movie tells the story of Rocky (Raja Krishnappa Bairya), a young boy without any help or means to support himself who is born into poverty in the heart of the streets of Mumbai. After the tragic loss of his mother at a young age, Rocky found himself with a promise to uphold his dying mother's wish — to become a rich and powerful man. With a fire in his stomach to rise above his situation, he becomes part of the underbelly of Mumbai and is moving up the ladder through fear, intelligence, and courage.
                Rocky's cutthroat ambition takes him to the Kolar Gold Fields (K.G.F) — a gigantic mining hub ruled by a ruthless gold mafia. The gold mine is run by Garuda, the heir of the Kavita family, who utilizes thousands of workers as utterly oppressed slaves. Rocky is sent to the K.G.F area as an undercover mission, but the true purpose of his mission is quickly overshadowed by a larger responsibility — to liberate the oppressed miners of K.G.F and take power from Garuda (and others) for himself.
                The movie concludes with Rocky burgeoning victorious over Garuda, symbolizing the rise of a new ruler and foreshadowing the larger war that awaits the viewer in Volume 2. </p>
            <p>The second part of the film starts right where the first leaves off. Rocky is now the legitimate ruler of Kolar Gold Fields, revered by his people, and feared by his enemies. But power brings commensurate danger. Ramika Sen, the Prime Minister (Raveena Tandon) feels that Rocky is a national threat. Then there is the emergence of a new enemy, Adheera (Sanjay Dutt), the ruthless and fearless brother of the deceased Garuda, who wants to take command of K.G.F.
                K.G.F: Chapter 2 sheds light on Rocky empire building, loyalty, and desire for supremacy. Although he is a criminal to the world, he becomes heroic to the oppressed miners and workers who see him as their champion. The film articulates the double-edged sword of power that can either liberate or destroy.
                The climax is filled with action and intensity involving tragedy and pathos, as Rocky is confronted with enemies and wrestles with his inner turmoil. K.G.F: Chapter 2 ends with a powerful ending or twist, setting the stage for K.G.F: 
            </p>Chapter 3, which is already in the works.</p>
