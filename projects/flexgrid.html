            <p>Halloween is celebrated annually on October 31st, and is a holdover to an ancient festival from the Celtics that occurred more than 2,000 years ago called Samhain. The Celtics believed that on this night, the line betwixt the living and the dead was blurred and spirits roamed the earth. In order to scare the spirits, Celtic people lit bonfires and dressed in costume. The holiday Halloween came from the term "All Hallows' Eve," which is the night before All Saints Day. Today, Halloween is celebrated all around the globe with events such as trick-or-treating, costume parties, haunted houses, and carving pumpkins, jack-o'-lanterns. Symbols of Halloween, such as jack-o'-lanterns, black cats, ghosts, and bats relate to superstition and the supernatural. With this rich combination of history, fun, and spooky customs there is a growing audience of children and adults who have begun to celebrate Halloween.</p>

In modern times, ghosts are a well-received part of Halloween's the aesthetics, costumes, and stories - and add an air of mystery and thrill to the holiday.</p>
