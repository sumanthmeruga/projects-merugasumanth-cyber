        <p>Swimming is among my preferred activities since it helps me stay in shape and de-stress. I usually enjoy going to the pool to work on different strokes and speed. Swimming in the water helps me remain calm and focus after a busy day.</p>

        <p>Additionally, I enjoy swimming because it is both an individual and team sport. I like to swim alone and challenge myself to set new goals. When I swim with someone, I enjoy the teamwork and encouragement. Swimming is a skill that I will use throughout my life.</p>
