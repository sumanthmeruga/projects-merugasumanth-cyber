        <p> The Telangana Secretariat which is located beside Hussain Sagar lake in the city Hyderabad serves as the principal administrative location of all the major offices and departments of Telangana State. It is a modern, uniquely designed building of which the state can be proud of as it embodies the true autocratic essence of governance and state of affairs; the new Secretariate complex was opened in the year of 2023 and it's official name is Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Telangana State Secretariat .

          Visitors can marvel at the structure, its buildings, gardens, and overall view of the Hussain Sagar Lake; truly a defining landmark of Hyderabad. </p>
