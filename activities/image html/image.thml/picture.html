        <p>1. What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</p>
        <p>JPEG is best for photographs or realistic images with many colors and smooth color changes, such as people, nature, or travel photos. It keeps good quality while making the file smaller.</p>
        <p>2. What kind of images are good to encode using PNG?</p>
        <p>PNG is great for images with sharp edges, like logos, text, or graphics. It keeps details clear and supports transparency, making it good for web images.</p>
        <p>3. What kind of images are good to encode using GIF?</p>
        <p>GIF is best for simple images with few colors, like animations or small graphics. It supports animation and transparency but has a limited color range, so it's not ideal for detailed photos.</p>
        <p>4. What is the difference between lossy and lossless compression?</p>
        <p>Lossy compression reduces file size by removing some data, which can lower quality (like JPEG). Lossless compression keeps all the original data, so the quality stays the same, but the file size is usually larger (like PNG and GIF).</p>
        <p>5. What is the difference between vector and raster images?</p>
        <p>Raster images are made of pixels and can lose quality when resized (like JPEG, PNG, GIF). Vector images are made of paths and shapes, so they can be resized without losing quality (like SVG).</p>
