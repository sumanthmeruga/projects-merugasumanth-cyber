      <h2>Packing & Safety Tips</h2>
      <p class="lead">Practical advice to help you pack smarter, travel safer, and stretch your travel budget. Following these tips will help you avoid common travel mistakes and enjoy a smoother, more enjoyable journey.</p>
      <h3>Packing Tips</h3>
      <p>Rolling your clothes tightly instead of folding saves significant space and reduces wrinkles. Packing cubes are a game-changer — they help organize your wardrobe, separate clean from dirty clothes, and make security checks faster. Don’t forget to pack a compact first-aid kit with essentials such as bandages, antiseptic wipes, and any personal medication. Travel-size toiletries will save space and are easier to carry through airport security.</p>

      <h3>Safety for Solo Travelers</h3>
      <p>Traveling alone can be liberating but requires extra precautions. Always share your itinerary with a trusted friend or family member. Avoid poorly lit streets at night and stay in areas with good reviews for safety. Use a secure password manager or cloud storage to keep digital copies of important documents such as your passport, visa, and travel insurance. Learning basic phrases in the local language can help you navigate situations and connect with locals more effectively.</p>

      <h3>Budget Travel Advice</h3>
      <p>Traveling on a budget does not mean sacrificing experiences. Visiting destinations during off-peak seasons often reduces accommodation and activity costs. Use public transport or walk when possible instead of taxis. Eating at local markets or street vendors not only saves money but also provides authentic cultural experiences. Compare prices for hostels, guesthouses, and homestays online, and track your expenses using a simple app or notebook to avoid overspending.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Etiquette</h3>
      <p>Understanding cultural etiquette can make a huge difference in your travel experience. Research dress codes, local customs, and gestures before you go. Always ask permission before taking photographs of people, and respect rules at religious or sacred sites. Engaging with locals respectfully not only enriches your experience but also fosters positive interactions and helps preserve cultural heritage.</p>

      <p>Example of local custom: In Chefchaouen, Morocco, visitors are encouraged to dress modestly and ask before photographing locals. Observing these practices ensures respectful interactions and a memorable experience. For more information: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chefchaouen" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>
