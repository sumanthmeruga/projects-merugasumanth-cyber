        <p>Swimming is amongst my preferred activities since it helps me stay in shape and de-stres. I usually enjoy going to the pool to work on different strokes and speed. Swimming in the water helps me remain calm and helps me focus after a busy day.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I enjoy swimming, as it is an individual and team sport. I like to swim alone and challenge myself to set new goals. When I swim with someone, I enjoy the teamwork and encouragement. Swimming is a skill that I will use throughout my life.</p>
