        <p class="darker bolder">List out the different ways to select an item.</p>
        <p class="darker love">In this code, we can select items by their tag name (like p for all paragraphs), by ID (like #firstP for the first paragraph), by class (like .darker or .bolder), or by where they are (like footer p to style only the paragraph inside the footer).</p>
        <p class="darker bolder">What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</p>
        <p class="darker love">An ID (id="firstP") is for one special element only, while a Class (class="darker") can be used on many elements to give them the same style.</p>
        <p class="darker bolder">What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</p>
        <p class="darker love">In the footer, the SPAN (<span class="darker bolder">gowri mogali</span>) is used for a small part inside a sentence, while a DIV is for bigger blocks or sections.</p>
        <p class="darker bolder">What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER?</p>
        <p class="darker love">A DIV is just a plain box with no meaning, but HEADER, MAIN, and FOOTER already tell us what part of the page they are (top, middle, or bottom)</p>
        <p class="darker bolder">What are the different ways to select a color?</p>
        <p class="darker love">We can give colors by name (like red), HEX code (#ff0000), RGB (rgb(255,0,0)), or HSL (hsl(0,100%,50%)). For example, you could make #firstP red using any of these styles.</p>
