        <p><strong>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</strong></p>
        <p>
            Inline CSS means you write the style inside the tag itself.  
            Embedded CSS means you write the style inside the HTML file but in the &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; section.  
            External CSS means you write the style in a separate file and connect it to your HTML.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</strong></p>
        <p>
            We should use external CSS because it makes the website neat, easy to update, and you can use the same style for many pages.

        <p><strong>What is a selector used for?</strong></p>
        <p>
            A selector is like a pointer that tells CSS which part of the webpage (like headings, paragraphs, or buttons) should get the style.
