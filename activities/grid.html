                <p>Elements in HTML can be inside other elements. When an element holds other elements it is known as the parent, and the other elements contained in the parent element are referred to as children. The parent-child relationship is important when using Flexbox or Grid layout because layout properties, such as display: flex or display: grid apply to the children to alter their layout. Without the parent-child relationship, a layout system cannot document or organize elements.</p>
                <p>In HTML, elements are capable of being placed inside of other elements. When an element contains other elements, it is considered the parent, and the elements contained inside of the parent element are considered children. This parent-child relationship is important when using layout systems like Flexbox or Grid because the layout properties (display: flex and display: grid) apply to the children to reformat them in some way. Without the parent-child relationship, layout systems would not be able to document or organize elements.</p>
